# C++ Space Game

This is a fork of a space shooter game created by Chadderbox. After watching
his video on making the game, I felt inspired to try and build the code for
myself so I could play the game. Unfortunately I experienced some segmentation
faults while playing, so my natural inclination was to rewrite the game and fix
the bugs. Here is the rewritten version!
